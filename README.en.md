# Natlan (Natlan Live Symphony Performance ver.)

* Vocal: ANRI (for now)

This is a `git` repo, which means you can navigate to a previous version of the project easily.
I have created tags along this process, so that you can check out the tag and listen to what it sounded like.
For example:

```bash
git checkout add-timbre-params
```

The list of tags are visible in multiple places, including
[Releases](https://github.com/iluminar-yi/natlan-iluminar-cover/releases),
where rendered output files are published.
